# Bellabeat Case Study


# Introduction 

This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Following the six-step analysis process—Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act—I analyzed smart device fitness data to uncover user behavior trends and recommend marketing strategies for Bellabeat, a health-focused manufacturer of smart wellness devices.

# Scenario
A junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused
products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the
global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart
device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of
Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat
executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

Standardized Column Names

Converted to lowercase + snake_case

Added derived columns:

activity_date

day_of_week

n_day_of_week

Checked for missing values

Removed duplicates

Validated data consistency and user counts

# Data Cleaning

Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned by,
1. Creating and renaming columns.
   making all names lowercase and snake case.
   adding columns activity_date, day_of_week, and n_day_of_week
3. Checking for null values
4. Checking for duplicates

<img width="629" height="132" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 12 33 38 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd74b84c-57ac-4137-ba32-48d706c0c2c4" />
<img width="334" height="632" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 12 33 55 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb7305e-ef08-470e-a3e8-3b91c0bc26d6" />

# 4. Analyze
The central question:

What trends exist in smart device usage?

To explore this, I grouped users by activity levels and analyzed relationships among calories, steps, and activity minutes.

<img width="675" height="500" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 12 40 25 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02c0371f-df88-4ad8-86f9-04db68ab58b7" />

<img width="697" height="263" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 12 45 17 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70afe22e-15df-4a45-b5af-bda262a4d87f" />

we then looked at correlation between activity level in minutes and calories,percentage of activity in minutes, average steps per day, correlation between steps and calories burned.

# 5. Share

# 1. Steps vs. Calories Burned

The average active user walked ~10,000 steps and burned ~2,000 calories.

"Very active" users exceeded 10k steps but represented a small portion of the dataset.

<img width="694" height="480" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 12 46 04 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5082903c-5015-4bc0-8e73-8bbcfb2f3ebd" />

we can see the average active person walked around 10k steps and burned 2k calories 

while the very active people were over 10k steps but were not the majority of users.


# 2. Average Steps by Day

Most active days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday

Least active day: Thursday

This suggests weekly behavioral patterns that marketing can leverage.

<img width="712" height="470" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 12 46 16 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6943aa62-705c-405b-b585-d346ad5acea3" />

we can see that the days Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday were the day people were most active. While thursday was the day with the least activity.

# 3. Activity Category Percentages

The majority of logged activity was light activity (e.g., walking).

Most users are casual exercisers, not athletes.

<img width="705" height="396" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 12 46 25 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbecd846-6c62-4fca-bbba-03faae827bc8" />
Sedentary Time

Users spent a significant portion of their day sedentary—likely due to work, commuting, or sleep.

we can see that most the activity was caegorized as light activity. meaning, most of the customers are using the device for more casual workouts.

# 4. Activity Minutes vs. Calories
Even users with high activity minutes typically stayed under 3,500 calories/day.

Suggests moderate-intensity workouts rather than endurance training.

<img width="760" height="560" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-23 at 12 46 36 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/122841b4-0fce-4138-a92b-bf0f3ebb73ce" />

Daily Workout Duration

Most users exercised under 300 minutes per day, averaging ~30 minutes.

# 6. Act — Recommendations

Recommendations

🎯 Target Everyday Wellness Users

Most users aim for manageable goals like burning 2,000–2,500 calories/day—not elite training levels.
Marketing should reflect this.

📅 Advertise Before High-Activity Days

Activity peaks on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday.
Bellabeat can increase engagement by promoting workouts and features on Monday and Friday.

🚶 Emphasize Step-Based Goals

Most users walk 10k steps or fewer, making campaigns like:
“Reach your 10,000 steps with Bellabeat.”
highly relevant.

🌿 Focus on Light & Moderate Activity

Market to users who prefer:

Walking

Light cardio

Short daily routines

General wellness habits

⌚ Promote Consistency (30-Minute Workouts)

Daily reminders, streaks, and habit-building features align well with user behavior.

💤 Sedentary Insights = Opportunity

Highlight:

Sedentary alerts

Stress/breathing reminders

Sleep tracking

These features match how users wear their devices throughout the day and night.


# Conclusion
Trends show to target customers that want to hit 2500 calories burned and do light workouts for less than 30 minutes per day. These trends show who Bellabeats main group of customers are.

The data reveals that most users engage in light to moderate physical activity, with habits centered around walking and short daily routines. 

To maximize growth, Bellabeat should emphasize wellness, achievable goals, and everyday habit-building rather than high-intensity fitness.
